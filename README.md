Project motivations: In the present digital age, in which many tasks are performed using computers, people have a greater need for laptops to meet their job qualifications, school requirements, app development, children's tutoring, video gaming, and much more. While several factors affect the pricing complexity of devices, including the company, screen size, memory, etc., laptop buyers often find it challenging to determine their desired specifications within their financial constraints. With the chosen dataset (laptop prices), we believe we can help confused buyers identify laptop prices based on their preferred specifications.
